# MyFirstPhaserGame
Using Phaser 3 Tutorials to create a basic game in Typescript.

Typescript was chosen because my background as a C developer leads me to prefer hard typing. Additionally, it was chosen to make the learning curve easier with better intellisense support. 

#Setup

I used Visual Studio Code as my project editor. It is my preferred editor due to the intellisense plugins. 
You'll need to install:
Node.js
Node package manager
npm install -g parcel-bundler

#Running the example locally
In a command prompt (or visual studio code terminal) navigate to the folder in which you downloaded this project.
Enter the command 'npm run start'

Then open your favorite browser and enter this address:
http://localhost:8000
